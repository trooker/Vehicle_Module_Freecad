**Welcome to FreeCAD GM_Vehicle!**

## Introduction
GM_Vehicle ModuleFreeCAD is an Opensource workbench for [FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org). The module/workbench supports ground mobile vehicle design by providing several tools commonly used in vehicle architecture, performance, function and vehicle useability.

This major version employed the FreeCAD Workbench template found at <https://github.com/FreeCAD/freecad.workbench_starterkit>.

## Features
It currently offers the following tools:

1> Create a virtual land based vehicle suitable support rendering in an actual assembly format.

2> Links to Cascadia Motion EVBot allowing the creation of dynocharts for electric vehicle desing.

3> Links to Abbottanp.com where the discussion/analysis is presented for GM vehicles suitable for weapons system platform missions
4> Links to MotorMatchup.com to allow visualization of EV and ICE vehicle performance as sepcified by a desginer.

5> Supports the rendering of EV GM_vehilces within the FreeCAD environment.

6> Facilitates the "feedback loop" between FreeCAD rendered EV designs, EV component desgin/modifications, visualiztion of performance under various surface and weather condiitons.

TBD

## Install

This workbench/module is currently only available as in a private GITHUB repositoty.

This workbench will eventually be available for download via the FreeCAD [Addon Manager].  It will also be available for manual downloading to the designer's Mod folder in the disigner's local FreeCAD environment.  See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXN7TOg3kj4  or/and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYevV8zy5sM  for instructional videos on FreeCAD installation and installing workbenches.

## Usage

Documentation for this workbench is available on the [Vehicle Workbench wiki page] TBD

## Tutorials

* Official Vehicle Workbench Tutorial TBD
* Four "useful" examples are provided to allow a rapid movement down the learning curve.
* Six "quickstart" project templates are provided to aid the designer in overcoming the initial learning inertia.

## Roadmap

There are many tools and features which will be implemented in this module:

 - Wiki documentation
 - Tutorials
 - Vehicle desgin
 - Vehicle rolling resistance
 - Vehicle performance curves/plots
 - TBD

## Discussion/Feedback

Discuss bugs, feedback, thoughts etc.. on the official [FreeCAD forum thread](https://forum.freecadweb.org/

## Bugs/Enhancements

Please open tickets in the

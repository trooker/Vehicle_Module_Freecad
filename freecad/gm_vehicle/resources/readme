Please note the following:


1> the following Example Files are too large to display on the current GITHub version.

022_998.1_2seat_tabbyChasis.FCStd
022_998.1_2seat_tabbyChasis.FCStd1
022_998_2seat_tabbyChassis.FCStd
022_998_2seat_tabbyChassis.FCStd1
057_004_300_998_motor_im225_shaft.FCStd
057_004_300_998_motor_im225_shaft.FCStd1

2> FCStd files appearing in the "resources" folder will need to be transferred to the "Examples" folder
for the FCStd files accessible.  As of 2/17/2025, AAP will accomplish that sometime in the future.  Otherwise 
you will need to move them yorself.
